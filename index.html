                <h2 class="display-6">Where I Am</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a programmer. I like to solve problems and make cool things. I am in the process of completing my second year of the Web Programming
                    diploma at NSCC. Through this course, I have gained many technical skills that will aid me in my future career, and I look forward to learning
                    more in the months ahead. This year has been especially difficult as I have not been able to interact with my peers and I thrive on
                    feedback.

                <p>
                    My career goals are firmly planted in a corporate setting. I would like to begin at a company at an entry level, to meet and learn
                    from fellow programmers. Through this, I would gain valuable experience from developers, about topics that I may not have much experience 
                    with. For example, my knowledge of launching a finished product is relatively limited, as I've never experienced one. Eventually, I would 
                    like to work on software that other developers rely on. Software such as internal tooling, public frameworks, or completely new 
                    technologies available privately or publicly.

                    and <span class="font-weight-bold">Javascript</span>. These are skills that are actively being refined by attending the Web Programming at NSCC. I've
                    been able to integrate these skills into all my courses by using web sites in place of documents when I can. This extra practice allows me to become 
                    more comfortable and accurate when dealing with web technologies.

                    One non-technical skill pops out as well, <span class="font-weight-bold">Demonstrated Leadership Abilities</span>. I refine these skills by practicing 
                    them as the team leader of the Recruitment Team for the IT Job Fair 2021. I am responsible for organizing a group of eight other students, and ensuring
                    that tasks are being completed. Just recently we completed sending initial invites to companies, a full month before they were sent last year. This will
                    ensure potential attendees have the most up-to-date information about the job fair. Credit where credit is due, I have an amazing team on the Recruitment 
                    Team this year.

                    This was my final project from the Intro to Programming course last year. I used HTML, CSS3 and Javascript to create an app that allows a
                    user to select a country and view an image of that countries flag. In addition, information about the country, which was stored in a JSON
                    file was also displayed to the user. This was my first attempt at unifying these three technologies into a single app. Before, I had only
                    integrated HTML/CSS, and Javascript/HTML. Looking back, I can tell by my design, the simplicity of the design and the plain colors, that 
                    my CSS skills were still developing. I can also tell, looking at my code, that I had just begun to explore the features of ES6, such as 
                    arrow functions and asynchronous functions. These would prove to be the basis for modern web frameworks like React.

                <p>
                    This was the final version of an assignment from the Special Topics course, where we covered Electron. Electron is a version of the Chromium 
                    engine that is used to power web apps natively on various devices. It integrates the Node.Js environment which also runs on the Chromium
                    engine. I used an Electron Starter NPM package to bootstrap Electron, so i could begin development right away. The app, which is supposed to 
                    imitate a wizard's spell book, allows users to add, view, update, and delete (CRUD) spells from a virtual spell book. These changes are 
                    persisted using a Node implementation of SQLite, a relational database engine, and a file located on the userâ€™s device. This was my first 
                    experience with creating an app combining server-side and frontend technology, so it was a bit of a learning curve. In particular, 
                    it was difficult at first to understand how Electron communicated with the rendered page, which I came to learn was called the render process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My design this time around was far more intricate, incorporating background images, custom fonts, and a distinct color scheme. Upon reflection, 
                    the design I chose for this program was a bit of a "novelty" design. For example, the page does not React to the window resizing because the 
                    image of the book does not scale. To mitigate this, I disabled the ability for the user to resize the window, but it is not what would be 
                    considered a modern web app.

                <p>
                    This was my final project for the Special Topics course where we covered Electron. For this app, I decided to recreate the functionality of the Wizard's
                    tome app, but with a modern interface. This interface uses CSS Grid and Flex-Box to create a responsive interface that resizes its contents depending on
                    the window size. In addition, I opted to use the React framework to control the frontend of the app. This allowed me to use React's component-based nature 
                    to build the app, and "react-router" to handle switching components dynamically. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Unlike the Wizard's Tome, I did not use the Electron Starter package from NPM. Instead, I used the "create-react-app" starter package, and integrated Electron 
                    into it. I encountered an issue where, if Electron started before the React server, React would throw an error about missing data. To solve this problem, I
                    discovered that I would need to control when Electron started. I was able to solve the problem by using a NPM package called "foreman", which allows you to
                    use a "procfile" to run Node commands, and a custom Node script, which waited for a connection to the React server before starting Electron. While I did 
                    eventually solve the problem, it was a difficult experience for me, as I had little experience dealing with the complexity of Node. However, Because of this 
                    challenge, I was able to learn more about how React and Electron work.

                <h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    One thing I did not mention is that Fizz Nizzard's Spell Book was created almost exactly one year after Map Quiz. I think that these three examples of my work 
                    clearly show the progress I have made over the past year. The progress I made is impressive to look back at, and I am amazed I learned so much in such a short
                    amount of time. I believe this is because of how much I enjoy creating for the web. It is easy to get started developing for the web (all you need is a text
                    editor!), however the tools that are available allow for very powerful tools for developers. I have been a hobby programmer for several years, but since I have 
                    begun my exploration of web technologies, I have been passionate about creating things for the web, and I think my portfolio shows it. If you have not yet 
                    visited the linked Github repositories, I would like to recommend visiting them now, as they contain more information about each project.
